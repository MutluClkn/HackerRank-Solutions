# Question

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

## Example

arr = [1,1,0,-1,-1]

There are  elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are

2/5 = 0.4000  ,  2/5 = 0.4000  ,  1/5 = 0.2000

Results are printed as:

0.400000

0.400000

0.200000


Print the following  lines, each to  decimals:

1. proportion of positive values
2. proportion of negative values 
3. proportion of zeros


## Sample Input
```
STDIN           Function
-----           --------
6               arr[] size n = 6
-4 3 -9 0 4 1   arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]
```

## Sample Output
```
0.500000

0.333333

0.166667
```
